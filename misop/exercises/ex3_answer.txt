After normalizing, the mock sample has richness 30, Shannon entropy 4.0 bits.
The alpha diversity values did not change.
They did not change because normalizing doesn't change whether an OTU
is present (richness) or its frequency (Shannon).
Actually, this is not strictly correct because normalizing changes
the frequency slightly because of rounding to a nearest integer,
and an OTU can disappear if a small value is rounded to zero.
