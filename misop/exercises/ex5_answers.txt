At the time I made the tutorial, there are eleven
Pseudomonas species with 100% identity BLAST hits
to Otu20:

P. antarctica
P. azotoformans
P. costantinii
P. extremorientalis
P. fluorescens
P. lurida
P. meridiana
P. poae
P. simiae
P. tolaasii
P. trivialis

You may find more if new sequences have been added to
the 16S database.
