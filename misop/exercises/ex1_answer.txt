Otu1, Otu2 and Otu3 are in phylum Bacteroidetes.

Genus bootstrap values are 0.36, 0.46 and 0.55.
(Your values may be slightly different because bootstrapping uses
random numbers).

At the time I made the tutorial, top hit identities according to NCBI
BLAST were Otu1 92%, Otu2 94% and Otu3 92%. For all three, the top hit
was Muribaculum intestinale strain YL27. The identities are <95% so we
cannot identify a genus. This may change as new sequences are added
to the 16S database.

The most common phylum is Firmicutes (178 OTUs).
