This is the PowerPoint presentation presented in ECES450/650 on February 13th 2024.
The Tutorital5Picotte is the code that you can copy and paste to replicate what was done in the presentation. 
The misop folder has all the bash files used, outputs and the addition of excersise answers from the drive5 usearch website if you decide to try doing the activity yourself.

In class we were asked:
What is the default clustering order if you don't specify one such as user input order or sequence length order?
-> Unfortunately the documentation doesn't really say. But Dr. Rosen said that her colleagues say it is based on length order, which we trust.

Maitland said that species wasn't specified because of it being the free version verses running the full version.
->That is not the case, it actually has to do with the database! Not every database has taxonomy as specific as species, and the one used in the examples 
happens to use one of those databases.
